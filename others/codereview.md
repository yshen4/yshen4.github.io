# Code review guide

## Goals of code review

There are many goals of peer review of committed code, here are some of them:
- Share knowledge
- Improve code quality
- Find accidental bugs
- Improve code consistency and maintenability
- Security check
- Regulatory check
- Mentoring and collaborating

While it is obvious, the following are not the goals for code review: 
- Peer review isn't to pick on the code committer, or slow down the process. 
- Peer review isn't to show the reviewers are senior than the committer. Peer review is classless. Many times, in this specific domain, the committer knows more than reviewers so s\he is more senior in the domain. 

## Prepare for code review

- Run necessary testing: unit test, integration test, and code difference check
- Describe the changes to help reviewers understand the context
- Limit code size to reduce reviewers' time and project progress
