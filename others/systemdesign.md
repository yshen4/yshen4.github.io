# System design

System design involves 6 steps:
- Functional requirements (API)
- Non-functional requirments (quality)
- High level design
- Detailed design
- Bottlenecks and tradeoffs

![Summary](/resources/img/systemdesign_summary.png)

## Requirement clarification

In requirement clarification, focus on 4 key areas:
- User/customers
- Scale (read/write)
- Performance
- Cost

User    | Scale     | Performance   | Cost
--------|-----------|---------------|--------
Who/how | QPS/TPS, size/query, spike | p99 latency, write to read delay | development/maintenance 

Function vs non-function

### Functional requirements

### Non-function requirements

- Scalability
- High availability
- High performance

## High level design

High level design covers the big picture workflow and services
- Data and store
- Processing
- High level architecture diagram

### Store design

1. What to store?
  - Data
  - Data schema
  - Requirements: read/write, latency, scalability, availability, fail-over
  - Transaction or analysis?

2. Where to store?
  - Compare db options related to non-function requirements
  - Hwot to scale write/read
  - How to make both read/write faster?
  - How not to lose data
  - How to maintain data consistency?
  - How to make sure data integrity?

3. How to store?
  - 

### Processing

1. How to scale? Partitioning
2. How to achieve high throughput? In-memory(cache)
3. How not to lose data? Replication
4. What to do when database is unavailable or slow? Replication/checkpoint

Problem 1: Aggregate data
1. Should we pre-aggregate data in processing logic?
  - Design 1: 3 updates, 3 count increase to database (3 x +1)
  - Design 2: 3 updates, processing logic aggregate them, 1 increase to database (+3)
  - Choice: design 2

2. Push or pull
  - push model won't handle situation when processing unit fails
  - push model won't scale when processing unit takes long time to process
  - pull model adds queue/persistency between event source and processing units, avoid both problems.
    - checkpointing: queue remembers the offset for each consumer to ensure sequence and failover
    - partitioning: 

## Detailed design for processing
  - Deduplication cache
  - 

### Ingestion path
1. API
  - blocking vs non-blocking I/O
  - Buffering and batching
  - Timeouts
  - Retries with exponential backoff and jitter
  - circuit breaker

2. Load balancer
  - Software vs hardware LB
  - Network protocol
  - LB algorithm
  - DNS: avoid LB single point of failure
  - Health checking (HTTP 200 response?)
  - High availability (primary LB, replica LB)

3. Partition service and partition
  - partition strategy
  - service discovery
    - server side discovery: partition registers itself to ZooKeeper
    - client side discovery: load balancer
  - Replication
  - Message format: backward compatibility
    - json
    - protobuffer
    - thrift

## Bottlenecks and tradeoffs
How to identify bottlenecks?
