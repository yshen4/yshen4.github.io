# Coding
My work started from C/C++, then moved to .net framework and C# (certifed Microsoft C# developer). an then I changed back to C/C++ and Linux development, I used a lot of python  to automate C/C++ programs. Most recently, I used Java and ReactJS for full stack development.

## C/C++
## Java
## Python
## Javascript/React
- [ReactJS concepts](coding/javascript/devnotes.md)
- [Redux concepts](coding/javascript/reduxnotes.md)

## C#
