# Technologies
![bragging](/resources/img/logo.png)

I build software solutions to be deployed in cloud. In past, I have used many technologies in infrastructure, storage, search, cache, and streaming.

# Algorithms in C++
I have met many developers in the field, and have used both C++ and Java extensively in the career. One thing separates C/C++ developers from Java progammers is C/C++ developers always ask why and how the algorithms work, while Java programmers assume the libraries take care of the efficiency issues. Sometimes I become the outlier because I always ask the obvious questions. In the work, I have used several data structures and algorithms to improve computing performance and reduce glitches.

## Data structure
- Array
- LinkedList
- Stack/Queue
- Heap
- Tree
- Graph
- Hash map

## Sorting
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Heap sort
- Quick sort + quick select

## Search
- Binary search
- Depth first search
- Breadth first search

## Dynamic programming

Important DP problems and algorithm design:
- Shortest path
- Text justification
- Edit distance
- Parenthesization
- Knapsack
- Blackjack

# Coding
My work started with C/C++, then moved to .net framework and C# (certifed Microsoft C# developer). Thereafter, I came back to C/C++ and Linux development. I used a lot of python to automate C/C++ programs. Most recently, I used Java and ReactJS for full stack development.
