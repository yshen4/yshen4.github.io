# Technologies
![bragging](/resources/img/logo.png)

I build software solutions to be deployed in cloud. In past, I have used many technologies in infrastructure, storage, search, cache, and streaming.

## Cloud computing with AWS
- [Cloudformation concepts](infrastructure/AWS/conceptnotes.md)
- [CDK](infrastructure/AWS/CDK.md)
  * [Example: Lambda](infrastructure/AWS/CDK_lambda.md)
  * [Example: context and environment](infrastructure/AWS/CDK_context.md)
- IAM
- EC2
- S3
- DynamoDB
- RDB

## Cassandra
- Deploy Cassandra on AWS
- Data modelling
- Performance tuning

## Elasticsearch
- Deploy Elasticsearch on AWS
- Data modelling
- Performance tunning

## Redis
- Deploy Elasticsearch on AWS
- Rate limiter with Redis

## ZooKeeper
- Deploy ZooKeeper on AWS

## Kafka
- Deploy Kafka on AWS
- Kafka streaming

## Druid
- Deploy Druid on AWS
- Druid modelling
- Integrate Druide with Kafka Streaming

# Algorithms in C++
In the work, I have used several data structures and algorithms to improve computing performance and reduce glitches.

## Data structure
- Array
- LinkedList
- Stack/Queue
- Heap
- Tree
- Graph
- Hash map

## Sorting
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Heap sort
- Quick sort + quick select

## Search
- Binary search
- Depth first search
- Breadth first search

## Dynamic programming

Important DP problems and algorithm design:
- Shortest path
- Text justification
- Edit distance
- Parenthesization
- Knapsack
- Blackjack

# Coding
My work started with C/C++, then moved to .net framework and C# (certifed Microsoft C# developer). Thereafter, I came back to C/C++ and Linux development. I used a lot of python to automate C/C++ programs. Most recently, I used Java and ReactJS for full stack development.

## Python
