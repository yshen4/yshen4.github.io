# Javascript essentials

## let/const/var
var defines a variable with the scope of a function, while let/const is in the block
```javascript
function sayI(n) {
    for (var i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        console.log(i);
    }
    console.log(i);
}

sayI(5); //0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

function sayL(n) {
    for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        console.log(i);
    }
    //Error: Uncaught ReferenceError: i is not defined
    //console.log(i);
}
```

## Objects

2 ways to define an object:
```
const person = {
  name: 'Yue',
  talk: function() { console.log( "talk the talk" ); },
  walk: function() { console.log( "walk the walk" ); }
};

person.talk();
person.walk();

const newPerson = {
  name: 'Yue',
  talk() { console.log( "talk the talk" ); },
  walk() { console.log( "walk the walk" ); }
};

newPerson.talk();
newPerson.walk();
```

## this
this keyword behaves different from this in other languages like C++ or Java. this in javascript depends on where it is used. 

```javascript
const person = {
    name: "Yue",
    walk() {
        console.log(this);
    }
};

// this is like normal c++ this, it points to the object
person.walk();
//Output: {name: "Yue", walk: ƒ}

// this points to global DOM window, which is default behavior 
const walk = person.walk;
walk();
//Output: {parent: Window, opener: null, top: Window, length: 4, frames: Window, …}

// To avoid the problem, use javascript function bind, which sets this
const boundWalk = person.walk.bind(person);
boundWalk();
//Output: {name: "Yue", walk: ƒ}
```

What if we use arrow function? Arrow function in javascript won't rebind this keyword. In the above case, we can refactor it:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Yue",
  walk() {
    self = this;
    setTimeout( () => console.log(this), 1000);
  }
};

const walk = person.walk;
walk();
//Output: {name: "Yue", walk: ƒ}
```

## Template literal
Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions. You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with them.

They were called "template strings" in prior editions of the ES2015 specification.

```
colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green'];
colors.map( color => `<li>${color}</li>`);
//Output: ["<li>red</li>", "<li>blue</li>", "<li>green</li>"]
```

## Destructing

```
const address = {
  street: "ethel street",
  city: "rolling hills",
  state: "california",
  country: "usa"
}

/*
const street = address.street;
const city = address.city;
*/
const {street, city} = address;

// alias country to nation
const {country: nation } = address
```

## classes

```
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  walk() {
    console.log( `${this.name} walks the walk` );
  }

  talk() {
    console.log( `${this.name} talks the talk` );
  }
}

const yue = new Person("Yue");
yue.talk();
yue.walk();
```

### Inheritance
```
class Teacher extends Person {
  constructor(name, grade) {
    super(name);
    this.grade = grade;
  }

  teach() {
    console.log( `${this.name} teachs the grade ${this.grade}` );
  }
}

const dino = new Teacher('dino', 3);
dino.walk();
dino.teach();
```

## spread operator
Spread operator can apply to both lists and objects.

### spread on array

```
const first = [1, 2, 3];
const second = [4, 5, 6];

// use concat
first.concat(second);

// use spread operator
[...first, ...second];

// clone with spread
const clone = [...first];
```

### spread on object
```
const namePart = { name: "Yue"};
const jobPart = { job: "Engineer"};

const combined = {...namePart, ...jobPart, location: "los angeles"};

// clone with spread
const clone = {...combined};
```

## modules
A js file is a module, which can be imported in other modules.

Usually an object in a module isn't visible outside. To make it public, use export key words:
export public function or objects
- default export if only one exported object: ```export default <object>```
- named export if multiple exported object: ```export <object>```

import function, classes, or objects
- For named exports, need {}: ```import { <object> } from <module>``` 
- For default export, no need for {}: ```import <object> from <module>```

```
//module 1: Person.js
export class Person() {}

//module 2: Teacher.js
import { Person } from './Person";

export default class Teacher extends Person {}

//module 3: main.js
import Teacher from './Teacher';

const dino = new Teacher("Dino", 3);
dino.walk();
dino.teach();
```

## value type vs reference type

Javascript has 5 primitive data types, which are passed by value: Boolean, null, undefined, String, and Number.

Javascript has 3 data types that are passed by reference: Array, Function, and Object, basically all object. Variables that are assigned a non-primitive value are given a reference to that value. That reference points to the object’s location in memory. The variables don’t actually contain the value. 

When a reference type value is copied to another variable using =, the address of that value is actually copied over as if it were a primitive. Objects are copied by reference instead of by value.

When no reference to the object exists, the Javascript engine can perform garbage collection.

### Memory model for value and reference types

Example for primitive data

```
let val = 1;
let copy = val;
console.log(val, copy);

val = 2;
console.log(val, copy);
```

Before the val = 2:
| variable  | value  |
|-----------|--------|
| val       | 1      |
| cop       | 1      |

After the val = 2:
| variable  | value  |
|-----------|--------|
| val       | 2      |
| cop       | 1      |

Example for referenc data

```
let ref = [1, 2, 3];
let ref_copy = ref;
console.table(ref);
console.table(ref_copy);

ref.push(4);
console.table(ref);
console.table(ref_copy);

ref = {name: "yue", work: 'engineer'};
console.table(ref);
console.table(ref_copy);
```

Before push(4):
| variable  | value  | Address  | Object |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| ref       | <#001> | #001     | 1,2,3  |
| ref_copy  | <#001> |          |        |

After push(4):
| variable  | value  | Address  | Object |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| ref       | <#001> | #001     | 1,2,3,4|
| ref_copy  | <#001> |          |        |

After reassign ref:
| variable  | value  | Address  | Object  |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| ref       | <#002> | #002     | {name: "yue", work: 'engineer'|
| ref_copy  | <#001> | #001     | 1,2,3,4 |

### == and ===

For primitive types, == and === are used to compare their values.

When the equality operators, == and ===, are used on reference-type variables, it checks their references.

Use the above examples:

```
let ref = [1, 2, 3];
let ref_copy = ref;
console.log(ref == ref_copy); //true

ref.push(4);
console.log(ref == ref_copy); //true

ref = {name: "yue", work: 'engineer'};
console.log(ref == ref_copy); //false

```

To compare values of 2 reference type variables, there are several ways:
1. Convert them to string and compare: JSON.stringify
2. Iterate the array or object to compare

A more generic discussion is available on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1068834/object-comparison-in-javascript)

### Passing as parameters

Passing in parameters follow assign = logic. 

Pure functions don't change passing in state. 
1. Paramters are value types, the function is always pure
2. Parameters are reference types, the function shall make a copy and return the copy if necessary.
