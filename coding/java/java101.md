# Java 101

This document is to list Java basics in developing data intensive applications.

For each item, we will discuss the problem, the context, options, and the solution.

## Language 101

### Tenary operator vs switch
- Problem: Nested ternary operators
The ternary operator is a substitute for an if-else statement, in which the ternary operator shortens the if-else statement into a single line. 
However, we can nest ternary operators like if-else statements, which is overly used and becomes unreadable and difficult to understand.

Here is an example with nested ternary operators:
```
int i = 5;
String result = i == 0 ? "a" : i == 1 ? "b" : i == 2 ? "c" : i == 3 ? "d" : "e";
```

- Options: use switch or if/else
While if/else is an option, switch/case is much easier to follow

What's more, switch (TableSwitch or LookupSwitch) are faster than if/else if there are more than 2 cases. While it isn't significant for most of applications, for data intensive application, it can become significant contributor to the latency. 

- Solution: prefer switch/case
Refactor with switch/case
```
int i = 5;

String result = null;
switch(i) {
case 0:
  result = "a"; break;
case 1:
  result = "b"; break;
case 2:
  result = "c"; break;
case 3:
  result = "d"; break;
default:
  result = "e"; break;
}

```

### Set complexity
Set provides interface for a collection of unique elements. Java provides 6 implmentations of Set: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, EnumSet, TreeSet, CopyOnWriteArraySet, and ConcurrentSkipListSet.

Implementation | add | remove | contains
-------------- | ---- | ------ | --------
HashSet        |O(1) |O(1)    |O(1)
LinkedHashSet  |O(1) |O(1)    |O(1)
EnumSet        |O(1) |O(1)    |O(1)
TreeSet        | O(logn) | O(logn) | O(logn)
ConcurrentSkipListSet | O(logn) | O(logn) | O(logn)
CopyOnWriteArraySet | O(n) | O(n) | O(n)
